## Quick Observation Prompts

These are simple questions I ask myself or testers after the session:

1. What words did we use when we dropped markers? Did we describe the same spot in different ways?
2. Where did we spend the most time to agree on a route? What extra info did we need there?
3. Did the order of the task cards change the conversation? Would another order feel different?
4. Did anyone feel lost in the model or ask for help with navigation?
5. When I read the log, which action shows up again and again? That might show a strong point or a gap in the talk.

Note: these are not formal surveys. They are just short reminders of my curiosity. I can turn them into real questionnaires later if needed.
