## Short Reading List & Notes

**1. Montello, D. R., & Raubal, M. (2018). _Spatial cognition and education._**  
Why: explains how people learn about space, and why VR scenes should respect the limits of our memory.  
What I note: ideas on how to talk about scale, direction and routes without confusing users.

**2. Dillenbourg, P. (1999). _What do you mean by collaborative learning?_**  
Why: offers simple words to study group work in shared spaces.  
What I note: signs of good teamwork (shared references, negotiation steps) that I can connect to the VR logs.

*(I plan to add one or two more short papers after each work sprint, so the reading stays manageable.)*
